    "Now, we will use MLflow logging and visualization capabilities to help us tune hyperparameters of neural networks. This is one of the major applications of experiment tracking frameworks. As neural networks have many hyperparameters, with complex interactions, and training them many times is very computationally intensive, we want to use human judgment, based on plots and metrics, to guide our choices in further experiments.\n",

    "A quick recap on main hyperparameters of MLPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning rate:**\n",
    "   - typically 1e-5 to 1e-1\n",
    "   - too high: loss explodes, model diverges\n",
    "   - too low: slow convergence, might get stuck\n",
    "   - sweet spot: fast convergence to good minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model size** - number of hidden units here:\n",
    "   - typically 32 to 512\n",
    "   - too few: underfitting, can't capture patterns\n",
    "   - too many: overfitting, slow training, diminishing returns\n",
    "   - consider: more features need more capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dropout rate:**\n",
    "   - typically 0.0 to 0.5\n",
    "   - 0.0: no regularization, risk overfitting\n",
    "   - too high: underfitting, loses important information\n",
    "   - purpose: prevents over-reliance on specific neurons\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Batch size:**\n",
    "   - typically 16 to 128\n",
    "   - small: noisy gradients, often better generalization, slower\n",
    "   - large: stable gradients, faster training, needs more memory, may overfit\n",
    "   - trade-off: speed vs generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Number of epochs:**\n",
    "   - too few: underfitting\n",
    "   - too many: overfitting\n",
    "   - optimal: when validation loss stops improving\n",
    "   - watch validation loss\n"
